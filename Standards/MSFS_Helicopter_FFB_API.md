# Proposal: An FFB-Oriented LVAR API for MSFS2024 Helicopters

**Status:** Proposal / request for comment
**Author:** Christian Krenn / DIY FFB project

## 1. What this is

This document proposes a **small, standard set of LVARs** (a "Helicopter FFB LVAR API")
a helicopter can expose to make FFB implementation straightforward.

---

## 2. Design goals for the API

- **Normalized and documented.** Positions/commands in a fixed unit and range
  with an explicit sign convention. No per-aircraft scale factors, no guessing
  inversion.
- **Intent, not implementation.** Expose *"trim actuator unclutched"* and *"trim reference is
  here"* explicitly.
- **Trim behaviour under full control of the aircraft.** As the rig receives all necessary signals directly there is no need to mirror the
  trim behaviour (TR/beep) on the FFB side and thus no risk of fighting or misaligned trim implementations.
- **Direction-explicit & mode-gated.** Every variable names who writes it, and the
  API only takes effect while the rig has switched the aircraft into FFB mode.
- **Discoverable & versioned.** The rig can detect whether the aircraft implements
  the API, which revision and which features.
- **Extendable.** Feature flags allow adding support for e.g. aero cues like VRS, RBS and ETL in future versions.

**Convention:** all variables live in the `L:FFB_*` namespace and use
dimensionless normalized units unless noted. Runtime variables are updated every
frame; the discovery/capability variables (§3.1 `API_VERSION` and `FFB_FEATURES`)
are static and read once.

---

## 3. Proposed API

The API is **mode-gated**: the FFB software turns it on, and while on, the
aircraft yields trim authority to the physical stick and publishes the state the
rig needs. Direction is stated per variable — **rig→aircraft** = the rig writes,
**aircraft→rig** = the aircraft writes.

The rig drives control position through the normal axis inputs (the physical
stick moves the aircraft as usual); this API covers only **trim, feel, and
hydraulics** — there is no need to bind "compensated" control inputs any more.

### 3.1 Discovery & mode

Controls: `CYCLIC`, `COLLECTIVE`, `PEDALS` (substitute `<CONTROL>`). A control
covers its axes — `CYCLIC` = both cyclic axes, `COLLECTIVE` and `PEDALS` one each.

| LVAR | Dir | Unit | Meaning |
|------|-----|------|---------|
| `L:FFB_API_VERSION` | aircraft→rig | number | API revision (start at `1`). `0`/absent = not implemented; the rig treats the aircraft as unsupported. |
| `L:FFB_FEATURES` | aircraft→rig | bitfield | Aircraft capabilities packed into one word — read **once** on connect (re-read on aircraft change), valid when `API_VERSION >= 1`. `0`/absent = no optional features, so the rig assumes nothing is trimmed. Bit layout below. This is capability, not runtime state: it does not change in flight and is not part of the per-frame group (§3.4). |
| `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_ENABLED` | rig→aircraft | bool | The FFB software sets `1` to switch **that control** into FFB mode — declaring the rig provides force feedback for its axes — and `0` on disconnect. Per-control, so a user with (say) only an FFB cyclic enables `CYCLIC` while collective and pedals stay in normal mode. Driving the mode from the rig removes the need for additional configuration settings on the aircraft's tablet/EFB that a user could arm by accident (and then wonder why the controls feel wrong). Must **not persist across aircraft load/reload** — power-up default is `0` — so a crashed or disconnected rig never leaves the next flight stuck in FFB mode. |

**`L:FFB_FEATURES` bit layout** (bit 0 = LSB). Positions are **frozen once published — append only**; never reorder or reuse a retired bit.

| Bit | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 0 | `CYCLIC` has trim — an auto-trim / trim reference the rig should spring toward (`_TRIM` is meaningful) |
| 1 | `COLLECTIVE` has trim |
| 2 | `PEDALS` has trim |
| 3–7 | reserved (trim / feel group) |
| 8+ | reserved (future capability groups) |

Read as a double, round to the nearest integer, then mask — `((int)round(value) >> bit) & 1`. Integer values are exact up to 2⁵³, so there is ample headroom.

### 3.2 Aircraft contract for a control while `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_ENABLED == 1`

For each control whose flag is `1`, the aircraft:

- **Zeroes that control's trim demand** — cyclic → `ROTOR LONGITUDINAL TRIM PCT` /
  `ROTOR LATERAL TRIM PCT`; collective / pedals → their equivalents — held at
  **0** so the sim's virtual control does not fight the physical one. More
  generally: suppress internal trim application and let the rig own that control; this removes the need to manipulate the control input to "compensate" for the internal trim depending on TR/fly-through state.
- **Publishes** the read-group LVARs (§3.4) for that control's axes every frame.
- **Restores** normal behavior when the flag returns to `0`, resuming its own trim/feel. This path is **required** so that disabling a control — or a rig disconnect — cleanly returns it to normal mode; a user re-arming mid-session for feel reasons is not an expected use case, but the restore path must exist.

### 3.3 rig → aircraft (signals the rig writes)

Axes: `CYCLIC_PITCH`, `CYCLIC_ROLL`, `COLLECTIVE`, `PEDALS`. Substitute `<AXIS>`.

| LVAR | Unit | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `L:FFB_<AXIS>_FLY_THROUGH` | bool | The rig detects a **fly-through** condition on this axis based on force or position deviation, depending on the FFB HW capabilities. The aircraft decides on how to use this information, most likely disabling autopilot/ASE auto-trim on this axis or its associated control. |

### 3.4 aircraft → rig (state the rig reads)

These variables are only meaningful while that control's `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_ENABLED == 1`; the rig must not consume them for a control in normal mode.

Per axis (`CYCLIC_PITCH`, `CYCLIC_ROLL`, `COLLECTIVE`, `PEDALS`):

| LVAR | Unit | Range | Meaning |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| `L:FFB_<AXIS>_TRIM` | number | −1..+1 | **Trim actuator position** within the control input range — the auto-trim's computed reference, independent of the zeroed `ROTOR *_TRIM PCT` (§3.2). Tracks the actuator; while trim release (TR) is active on that axis it follows the **current control input** — This removes all discontinuities (like `ROTOR *_TRIM PCT` jumping to zero under TR). If the control's `L:FFB_FEATURES` trim bit (§3.1) is `0`, the control has no trim system — the rig ignores `_TRIM` and applies no trim spring. |
| `L:FFB_<AXIS>_HYD_ASSIST_LOSS` | number | 0..1 | Hydraulic pressure loss as a fraction of nominal. The rig can use it (if available) to model heavy/locked controls on hydraulic loss and cold-and-dark. `0` = full boost, `1` = unassisted/locked. This convention ensures that the fallback on a missing value defaulting to zero is 'full boost' for an aircraft without hydraulics. |

Per control (cyclic trim can only be unclutched for both axes simultaneously):

| LVAR | Unit | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `L:FFB_CYCLIC_TR_ON` | bool | Cyclic trim actuators **unclutched** (like TR pressed or e.g. TRIM FEEL CYCL = OFF). Covers both cyclic axes. |
| `L:FFB_COLLECTIVE_TR_ON` | bool | Collective trim actuator **unclutched** (like C-SYNC pressed or e.g. COLLECTIVE TRIM FEEL = OFF). |
| `L:FFB_PEDALS_TR_ON` | bool | Pedals trim actuator **unclutched** (symmetry / future expansion). |

### 3.5 Conventions (normative)

- Normalized values are **−1..+1**, `0` = neutral / mid-travel. Positive = **pitch
  nose-up**, **roll right**, **collective up**, **right pedal (yaw right)**.

## 4. Lifecycle (rig side)

A worked sequence for the FFB software. Steps 1–3 run once per aircraft load;
step 4 is the per-frame loop; step 5 is the exit.

1. **Detect.** Read `L:FFB_API_VERSION`. If it is `0`/absent or below the rig's
   minimum supported revision, treat the aircraft as unsupported and stay in
   legacy mode — do not write any `L:FFB_*` variable. Stop here.
2. **Read capabilities once.** Read `L:FFB_FEATURES` and cache the bits
   (re-read on aircraft change, not per frame).
3. **Enter FFB mode.** For each control the rig physically provides, write
   `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_ENABLED = 1`. Leave controls the user has no FFB hardware
   for at `0` so they stay in normal mode.
4. **Per-frame loop** (while enabled):
   - *Write* `L:FFB_<AXIS>_FLY_THROUGH` per axis from measured force/position
     deviation.
   - *Read* `L:FFB_<AXIS>_TRIM`, `L:FFB_<AXIS>_HYD_ASSIST_LOSS`, and the
     per-control `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_TR_ON`.
   - *Update effects:* spring toward `_TRIM` — **unless** that control's
     `FFB_FEATURES` trim bit is `0` (then no trim spring); update friction/damping based on `_HYD_ASSIST_LOSS`; drop the trim spring while
     `_TR_ON == 1` so the control is free to reposition.
5. **Exit.** When a control's FFB ends — the user disables it, the rig
   disconnects, or the aircraft unloads — write `L:FFB_<CONTROL>_ENABLED = 0`.
   The aircraft restores normal trim/feel (§3.2).
